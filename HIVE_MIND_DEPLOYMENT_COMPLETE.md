## 📋 MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED

### 1. Create Railway Project (5 minutes)
```bash
railway init
# Select: "Raghav Dua's Projects" workspace
# Choose: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# Branch: railway-deployment
# Name: job-tracker-prod
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables (3 minutes)
```bash
railway variables --set "NODE_ENV=production"
railway variables --set "VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://zpobmujczdnbujkrabau.supabase.co"
railway variables --set "VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inpwb2JtdWpjemRuYnVqa3JhYmF1Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTI0NTY3NzksImV4cCI6MjA2ODAzMjc3OX0.e5Ph2fbiM3J7NX1s4w93ipU70s5iElFDGlLiZHBdHkM"
railway variables --set "VITE_APP_NAME=Job Tracker"
```
